# Findings from DSA-course:
- Mathematics Section:
    - Sieve of eratothenes is the most efficient method for finding primes

- Bitwise Section:
    
    - XOR operation can be used to fetch the occurence of a number.
    - We can fetch the rightmost set bit of a NUMBER using "NUMBER&~(NUMBER-1)"
    - We can generate power set i.e. given "abc" , we get ["","a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"] using bitwise operator
